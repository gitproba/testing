# Administration of SMS Accounts

## Purpose of This Guide

## SMS Account

This menu represents the list of SMS accounts for the different

The significance of creating the different accounts is to get the
billing isolated, so we get the bill per customer according to their

Annotation of phone numbers

**DLN** stands for Dedicated Long Number, which is basically the full
telephone number.

**Short code** is a special telephone number which is significantly
shorter than the usual phone numbers. These are used for value added
services, such as donations, ordering or voting. However, the billing
rate is higher than the usual pricing.

There can be more than one DLN associated with a particular account.
