# Introducing the Access Control

## Overview

Buzzeasy utilizes Role Based Access Control as a secure method of
restricting account access to authorized users. The method enables the
Portal Administrator to create and add users accounts via the console
and assign each user to a specific role. Each role has an explicit
permission set defined. Users can perform various actions based on the
range of their assigned roles.
