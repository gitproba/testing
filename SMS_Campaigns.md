# SMS Campaigns

## Overview

SMS Campaigns offer queue-less callbacks to customers. The customers do
not have to wait in line to arrange a callback request anymore. Instead
they receive a text message from the company or organization including a
new business proposal or if they wish to re-engage with them. The
customers can reply to the text to be offered with a callback request.
