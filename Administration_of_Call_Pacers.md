# Administration of Call Pacers

## Purpose of this Guide

This guide describes the steps of creating and maintaining call pacers
registered on the admin console.

## Call Pacers

Call pacing is an option to set to avoid a heavy flood of inbound calls
in your call center. It is possible to keep the contact center as
orderly as possible by setting the capacity of certain service queues
and to avoid an overwhelming quantity of calls on a specific service
line.

The related Service Queue(s) need to have the Schedule Call feature
enabled!
