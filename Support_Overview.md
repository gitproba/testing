## Notification Towards Customers

There are times when a notification relating the service needs to be
made to a customer. This notification will be made to the person named
on the Service and/or Technical contact on the Buzzeasy Order Form. 

## Triage Checks

The following checks should be made before raising a ticket with
Buzzeasy to ensure that the issue lies with Buzzeasy:

1.  Check if the queue phone number supplied to Buzzeasy is in service
    and reachable.  
      
2.  Check if the PC has a valid internet connection to reach the web
    pages.  
      
3.  Check if the external IP address is the same as supplied to
    Buzzeasy.  
      
4.  If text messages are not being sent by BuzzCampaign, check the
    wallboard to make sure it is not a duplicate  
      
5.  If a call has failed, check the Buzzeasy wallboard to see the reason
    under the "code" column. This will normally give you an idea of the
    reason why Buzzeasy had to reschedule or fail the call.  
      
6.  If there has been a failure on all attempts to dial your client,
    please check their number is in service by manually ringing them
    back.  
      
7.  The wallboard shows the record has failed – expired. This means the
    lifetime of the record has expired and you can re-insert that number
    to be in the system to send them another text message. If there is a
    current record still active in your campaign, any duplicate records
    will be marked as duplicate and not be processed.
