# In-Queue Callbacks

## Overview

In-Queue callbacks are one of the 'Banish the Queue' callback solutions
offered by Buzzeasy.

The customer has the option to request a callback when waiting for an
available operator in the call center's queue, or if they reached the
call center at its out of business hours. It is possible to request the
callback at an agreed time or when an agent becomes free to respond to
the customer's demand.
