# Administration of Contact Centre Numbers

## Purpose of this Guide

This guide describes the steps of creating and maintaining the phone
numbers related to the different service queues.

## Contact Centre Numbers

A Contact Centre Number is a phone number which is associated with a
specific service queue. Customers will receive the callbacks from this
number regarding their inquiry or existing case if they registered a
callback request in the particular queue. 

This page displays a list of existing contact centre numbers registered
in the system. 

Available Features are dependent on User Roles

Possible actions to take are dependent on the role assigned to a
specific user account.

Deletion and Editing are Disabled

Please note that editing and deletion of a phone number entry causes the
loss of related historical callback data, therefore both editing and
deletion are disabled by design.
